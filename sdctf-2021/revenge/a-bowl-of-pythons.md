### Simple Rev and XOR FTW!

#### Most part of the code isn't relevant. `h` is simply `print` and `d()` is a failure troll.

#### The first two `if` conditions are sanity check for the flag format of `sdctf{}`. The `a` is a fibonacci series generator. Hence our flag is `b't2q}*\x7f&n[5V\xb42a\x7f3\xac\x87\xe6\xb4'` XOR `fibonacci series & 0xff`

The Flag: `sdctf{v3ry-t4sty-sph4g3tt1}`
