### Write up for SDCTF by UC San Diego

#### First of all, many thanks to UCSD folks for organizing this great event. I loved how they conducted the entire event on discord.

* 2 days long event with challenges ranging from beginner to advanced in various categories like web, crypto, osint, pwn and rev.
* This repo contains writeups for some of those challenges that I solved as part of the team: `k3rn3l4rmy`. We finished on the 4th place. :)
